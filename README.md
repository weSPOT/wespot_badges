#WeSPOT Badges

Two components are part of the weSPOT Badges system (fully described in [D3.3](wespot.net/en/public-deliverables)):

* [Open Badge API] (/OpenBadgesAPI)
* [WeSPOT rules] (/weSPOTOpenBadgesv2)

Both components are deployable in [Google APP Engine](https://appengine.google.com/).

1. Open Badge API

Open Badge API is a set of REST services that can be used to store badges following the Open Badges specification. The services are described [here](http://wespot.net/apis/-/asset_publisher/84uK/wiki/id/21038428?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwespot.net%2Fapis%3Fp_p_id%3D101_INSTANCE_84uK%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26p_p_col_id%3Dcolumn-2%26p_p_col_count%3D1).
